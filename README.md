# Kormic Agent Pedigree System

> **New to Kormic?** Start with the [Quickstart Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) to get your first verified agent running in minutes.

Welcome to the Kormic Agent Pedigree and Trust Architecture. This repository houses the core modules ensuring agent authenticity, structured identity, tamper-evident history, correctness monitoring, and catastrophic recovery at a global scale.

## Architecture Status

This system currently implements the **Phase 1 (Core Pedigree)** and **Phase 2 (Global Scale & Recovery)** specifications of the trust architecture. It operates via infrastructure-agnostic protocols and manages agent pedigrees separately from behavioral correctness. All cryptography relies on software-emulated HSMs prior to Phase 3 hardware hand-over.

---

## Phase 1 Features (Core Cryptography)

### 1. Agent Pedigree & History Chain
- **Structured Identity:** Implements the `KMC.<type>.<entity_ref>.<instance>.<realid_hash>` format to ensure safe, immutable identities bound to real-world entities.
- **Birth Records (Self-Describing):** Every agent receives a sealed birth record containing its identity, guardrails, and creation timestamp. For crypto-agility, records are strictly self-describing, structurally sealing the cryptographic algorithm (`sig_alg`) and format version (`fmt_ver`) directly into the payload.
- **Tamper-Evident History:** Operational events are appended as history links, each containing the SHA-256 hash of the previous link.
- **Constant-Size Summary:** Avoids O(N) linear growth limits by tracking a fixed 64-byte `running_head` that updates with every new event, mathematically summarizing the entire history up to that point.

### 2. Verification Engine
- **FAST Verification (O(1)):** Rapidly confirms an agent's authenticity by verifying the origin signature and matching the current running head without traversing the entire history chain.
- **FULL Verification (O(N)):** Reconstructs the entire hash chain from the birth record, validating every link for dispute resolution and deep audits.
- **Trust Cache:** Supports short-lived trusted tickets to bypass expensive signature verifications on repeated checks, dramatically improving speed while preserving security.

### 3. Behavioral Monitoring (The Watchdog)
- **Decoupled Evaluator:** Operates entirely independently of the pedigree (cryptographic) system.
- **Metric Thresholds:** Evaluates rolling metrics including accuracy, overconfidence, guardrail hits, and latency drift.
- **Tiered Verdicts:** Automatically outputs `OK`, `FLAG`, or `HALT` verdicts based on tunable thresholds, isolating genuine agents that misbehave.

### 4. Cryptographic Key Custody & Crypto-Agility (Dev/Software Mode)
- **Epoch Keys:** Uses a root-and-epoch hierarchy for key rotation and revocation.
- **Crypto-Agility:** The system is fully algorithm-parametric for both signatures and hashing. Signatures explicitly declare their algorithm (`sig_alg`), and the history chain hash algorithm is declared at birth (`hash_alg`). The `MLDSASigner` and hash serializers dispatch validation dynamically, structurally preventing downgrade attacks while enabling safe migration to new standards.
- **Post-Quantum Signatures:** Upgraded to NIST Level 5 (`ML-DSA-87`) as the default for all root, epoch, and birth record signatures.
- **Agile Hash Strategy:** The system defaults to `SHA-256` for constant-size history chain link hashing and running head calculations, but is fully agile and allows allowlisted standards like `SHA3-256`.
- *Note: All keys currently use software-based implementations and are strictly marked with `# DEV_KEY_NOT_PRODUCTION` for safe testing prior to Phase 3 hardware isolation.*

---

## Phase 2 Features (Global Scale & Recovery)

### 5. Encrypted Recovery Twins
- **High-Churn Snapshot Optimization:** Replaces per-event backup syncing with a bounded `K-event` snapshot model, saving massive amounts of network bandwidth at the cost of a strictly bounded data-loss window (e.g., losing a maximum of `K-1` events).
- **AES-256-GCM Vaults:** Each Twin Snapshot is locked with military-grade AES-256 encryption. The system verifies the cryptographic MAC to ensure the backup has never been tampered with.
- **Shamir Key Shattering:** The AES Master Key is generated, immediately split into a polynomial 5-part Shamir quorum (e.g., given to 5 executives), and then permanently destroyed from memory. 
- **Catastrophic Key Ceremonies:** To wake a Twin during a server fire, 3 of the 5 hardware shares must be mathematically reassembled.

### 6. Distributed Registry Fan-Out
- **Central Authority:** A single root authority packages all globally revoked agents into a version-controlled, ML-DSA-44 signed `RegistrySnapshot`.
- **Regional Replicas:** Edge servers (e.g., US-East, EU-West, India-South) act as decentralized read-nodes, pulling Snapshots to maintain local authority. 
- **Latency Realism:** System accurately models "Residual Risk Windows" where an agent might temporarily pass verification in a distant region due to the physics of network propagation delay.

### 7. Scalable Revocation (Bloom Filter)
- **Zero-Memory Checks:** Replicas load the revoked agent IDs into highly compressed `ScalableBloomFilters`. 
- **Instant Verdicts:** Allows O(1) checks for revocation status. If the Bloom Filter flags an agent as "Maybe Revoked," the system falls back to a Tier-2 authoritative dictionary lookup.

---

## Phase 2.5 Features (Rogue-Agent Countermeasures)
This module hardens the runtime environment to mitigate shared-runtime bleed (like the 2026 Varonis Dialogflow incident) and unauthorized destructive actions (like the Replit incident).

### 8. Capability Manifest & Sandbox (C1)
- **Manifest Isolation:** The loose `guardrails` dict is upgraded to a strict capability manifest defining exactly what tools and network endpoints an agent can reach.
- **Runtime Enforcer:** The `Sandbox` wraps the agent at boot. It blocks any tools or endpoints not explicitly allowed in the manifest, ensuring shared infrastructure does not equate to shared authority.

### 9. Credential Root & FAST Challenge (C2 & Gap 1)
- **Fail-Closed Verification:** The FAST engine is mathematically forced to fail-closed, entirely rejecting "keyless" birth records and instantly blocking tokens missing signatures.
- **Anti-Replay Nonce Engine:** Agents must mathematically sign a random, server-issued challenge to prove possession of their birth keys. A strict 5-minute freshness window and memory-safe spent-nonce cache completely close the token-theft replay gap.
- **No Ambient Authority:** Agents do not receive standing API keys. They request 5-minute scoped credentials from the `CredentialRoot`. 
- **Irreversible Scopes:** Destructive actions (like refunds or deletes) are explicitly flagged and must be declared at birth to be issued.

### 10. Drift HALT Wiring
- **Automatic Revocation:** If the Sandbox blocks an out-of-manifest action, it registers a `MANIFEST_BREACH` in the Tamper-Evident History.
- **Behavioral Loop:** The breach is fed to the `BehaviorMonitor` which issues a `HALT`, automatically triggering global revocation via the `CentralRegistryAuthority`.

---

## Phase 3 Features (Hardware Readiness & Human Quorum)
This module secures the existential actions (Create, Destroy, Restore) and removes single points of failure at the human/admin layer.

### 11. Threshold Ceremony (Shamir Quorum)
- **Existential Quorums:** Generating an agent, restoring a Twin, or destroying a single agent mathematically requires `3-of-5` physical keys.
- **Catastrophic Quorum:** A total wipe of the registry requires the absolute largest quorum (`5-of-5`). No single "God Key" exists.
- **Cryptographic Key Validation:** Reconstructed keys are verified via constant-time HMAC validation against expected secure hashes, physically preventing fake or "math garbage" shares from passing the quorum.

### 12. Self-Defense
- **Self-Isolation:** Agents can voluntarily pull their own plug if they detect prompt-injection manipulation.
- **No Self-Destruct:** Reversible isolation is automated; irreversible destruction is strictly kept behind the human Threshold Quorum.

---

## Phase 4 Features (MeshKor SDK & Concurrency Safety)
This phase productizes the mathematical models into a usable, high-performance Python SDK.

### 13. Drop-in Abstractions
- **MeshKorAgent / ReceiverClient:** Hides the complexity of Pedigrees, ProofTokens, and Bloom Filters behind simple abstractions. `ReceiverClient.validate()` seamlessly validates incoming actions, while agents interact with `CredentialRoot.issue_scoped_credential()` for secure 5-minute scoped execution tokens.

### 14. High-Performance Concurrency
- **Sub-Millisecond SQLite:** Migrated from individual filesystem JSON blobs to a shared, persistent SQLite connection using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and memory pragmas, dropping write latency to <0.9ms.
- **Double-Lock Serialization:** Implemented strict per-agent threading locks and connection locks. This mathematically ensures that hundreds of multi-threaded AI events occurring simultaneously are never dropped or overwritten, maintaining absolute chain integrity.
- **Strict Default Security:** Cross-region Replay Protection is explicitly enforced by default via `central_sync` wiring.

---

## Phase 5 Features (Two-Tier Identity & Containment)
This phase solves the commercial "multi-tenant" problem, ensuring that a software vendor's build identity and a hospital's deployment identity are strictly separated, without creating a single point of failure.

### 15. The BAIN & DAIN Split
- **Build AIN (BAIN):** Issued to the software vendor for an immutable software release. It seals the *capability envelope* (the maximum allowed permissions).
- **Deployment AIN (DAIN):** Issued to the customer for a specific running instance. It seals the *operating manifest*, owner, and storage locus. It cryptographically links back to the BAIN.

### 16. Containment Envelopes
- **Mathematical Ceiling:** During DAIN enrollment, the requested operating manifest is strictly verified to be a subset of the parent BAIN's capability envelope. A customer cannot grant more power than the vendor allowed, and a vendor cannot silently expand a running deployment's permissions.

### 17. The Revocation Kill Switch
- **Two-Tier FAST Verification:** The `Verifier` Engine simultaneously authenticates both the DAIN signature and the parent BAIN signature.
- **Cascading Revocation:** If a vendor discovers a zero-day vulnerability in their software and revokes the `BAIN`, every single `DAIN` derived from that build is instantly and mathematically rejected by the system worldwide.

### 18. Cryptographic Storage Isolation
- **Per-Deployment Salt:** To ensure cross-deployment privacy, each DAIN is issued a unique cryptographic salt that is stored *only* in the local SQLite database. It is never transmitted to the global registry, ensuring that event hashes cannot be correlated by observers or the vendor.

### 19. Vendor Enrollment & Anti-Squatting
- **Bind-Once Namespaces:** Vendors must cryptographically enroll their identities to mint BAINs. The registry uses a strict `Bind-Once` invariant, guaranteeing an enterprise namespace (like "Acme") can never be silently overwritten or squatted by an attacker.
- **Proof of Possession (Replay-Protected):** Enrollment enforces strict Challenge-Response cryptography. The vendor must mathematically prove ownership of the private key by signing a payload binding a fresh ML-DSA challenge nonce issued by the central authority to their exact entity name (`f"{nonce}:{name}"`). The Central Authority enforces strict single-use memory on all challenges, making token-theft replays or namespace hijacking mathematically impossible.
- **Root-Signed Replication:** The vendor identity list is packaged into the global `RegistrySnapshot`. Replicas do not rely on local databases for vendor truth; they mathematically verify the root signature of the global snapshot to establish identity consistency worldwide.

## Phase 6 Features (Reconnaissance Gap Defenses & Identity-Bound Approval)
This phase strictly seals the "Reconnaissance Gap," where compromised agents could steal data without triggering an active log entry, protecting systems from scenarios like the Hugging Face RCE breach and Reddit scraping incident.

### 20. Read-Scope Manifests
- **Cryptographic Read Boundaries:** The `BirthRecord` securely seals `read_scopes` and `allowed_egress` manifests. A child deployment (DAIN) is mathematically constrained; it can only declare read scopes that are a strict subset of its parent vendor's authorized limits. 

### 21. Session-Scoped Environment Evaporation
- **Standing Credential Defense:** When an agent sandbox is initialized, the `Evaporator` securely scopes its execution context. Rather than altering the host machine's global environment, it identifies standing credentials (matching keys like `AWS`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`) and locks them in a session-only memory vault, yielding a mathematically scrubbed environment dictionary for sidecar or subprocess injection. 

### 22. Verified Reader Handshake
- **Platform-Side Verification:** The MeshKor SDK's `ReceiverClient.validate()` enforces a `"read"` action type. When an agent attempts to scrape or query data, the resource platform explicitly validates the agent's ProofToken against its `read_scopes`. If the token is valid but the scope is unauthorized, the read is denied. Replay attacks on the read token are structurally blocked.

### 23. Attested Egress Firewall
- **Session-Boundary Containment:** The Sandbox explicitly declares and attests the agent's `allowed_egress` target scope. True enforcement is paired with out-of-process network controls (like an infrastructure sidecar or proxy), ensuring multiple concurrent agents cannot clobber each other's network policies in a shared interpreter.

### 24. Identity-Bound Approval & Principal Anti-Impersonation
- **Principal Enrollment & Anti-Squatting:** Humans and organizational principals enroll insert-only using cryptographic proof of possession, mirroring vendor enrollment to prevent spoofed identities.
- **Consequential Approval Gates:** The system refuses to mint a Build AIN unless authorized by an enrolled principal. The approval must be a time-bounded, single-use `DelegationAssertion` signed by the principal.
- **Sealed Approval Chain:** The attested approval is cryptographically sealed inside the Build AIN's birth record, guaranteeing that receivers can verify the human approval directly from the cryptographic chain without trusting standard display names or checkboxes.
- **High-Fidelity Detection Signals:** Any attempt to use a counterfeit, expired, or non-enrolled identity at the approval gate fires a structured, high-fidelity detection event.

### 25. Detection Plane Consumability
- **Structured Sinks:** The Sandbox routes all rule violations to pluggable `DetectionSink` interfaces (like JSONL files or remote Webhooks).
- **Best-Effort Non-Blocking Emissions:** Sinks are strictly fire-and-forget. A timed-out webhook or broken disk will never crash the Sandbox or bypass the enforcement refusal.
- **Enriched Threat Signals:** Detection events include standardized `severity` (info, warning, critical) and explicitly map to a `session_id` to correlate an attack chain.
- **Ongoing Reconnaissance Digests:** If a compromised agent continually probes out-of-scope targets, the system emits a repeated "Ongoing Reconnaissance" critical digest, preventing alerting fatigue while ensuring attacks are never silenced after the first alert.

### 26. Software Tier Key Custody Thresholding
- **Root Operations Gating:** Routine operations (like agent birth) remain single-party. Existential "Root" operations (like generating epoch keys or capturing registry snapshots) are mathematically gated behind a Shamir Secret Sharing `k-of-n` quorum.
- **Cryptographic Ballot Box:** To satisfy a quorum, human holders must submit an ML-DSA-87 signature over the specific operation payload. Unsigned approvals, fake identities, or repeated single-party votes are instantly rejected.
- **Production Invariant:** The architecture explicitly declares that a threshold policy is mandatory in production deployments. Hardware custody integrations inherit this rule, ensuring single-party root keys never exist in live commercial environments.

---

## Phase 7 Features (Vendor Key Rotation & Back Catalog)
This module introduces complete Cryptographic Agility at the entity level, allowing vendors to rotate compromised keys without destroying the existing ecosystem of active agents.

### 27. Dual-Signature Handshake
- **Secure Handoff:** Vendors rotating a key must supply a payload dual-signed by both the *old* (revoked) key and the *new* key, proving both the intent to hand over authority and mathematical possession of the new key.
- **Automated Roll-Over:** The Central Registry automatically demotes the old key to the `historical_keys` list and stamps the new key as active, bumping the vendor's replication version.

### 28. Back-Catalog Preservation
- **Seamless Receiver Verification:** When a receiver node validates a `DAIN` derived from a `BAIN` issued years ago under a rotated key, the verification engine dynamically searches the vendor's `historical_keys` catalog. The agent's historical signature remains valid, preserving the lifetime of existing deployments without trusting compromised keys for *new* issuances.

## Phase 8 Features (Production Hardware Root of Trust & Persistent Control Plane)
This phase transitions the system from software-emulated keys to a strict, production-ready Hardware Security Module (HSM) architecture using FIPS 140-2 validated YubiKeys.

### 29. Strict Hardware-Enforced Custody
- **Physical Touch Policies (`--touch-policy ALWAYS`):** Cryptographic signatures require a physical human touch on the hardware. Even if malware compromises the admin's laptop, it cannot silently sign an operation.
- **APDU Constraint Satisfaction:** The integration strictly handles `0x6982` (Security Condition Not Satisfied) constraints, forcing PIN verification to occur milliseconds prior to the cryptographic signature command, preventing session hijacking.
- **ECDSA P-384 Cryptography:** The HQ Server backend (`hq_server.py`) cryptographically verifies the mathematical ECDSA challenge-response payload generated directly from the YubiKey's Slot 9C signature module.

### 30. Persistent Distributed Control Plane
- **Zero-Dummy Data:** The system completely replaces in-memory dummy data with a persistent SQLite storage layer (`hq_kormic.db`), ensuring Agent Twins, Suspects, and Revocations survive server restarts and scale seamlessly.
- **Automated Revocation Fan-Out:** The interactive `meshkor_admin.py` console allows administrators to securely revoke agents. This action manipulates the live database and instantly notifies the `CentralRegistryAuthority` to broadcast the revocation to all regional Sidecar replicas worldwide.
- **Hardware-Decrypted Agent Resurrection:** The system supports fetching AES-256-GCM encrypted Agent Twins directly from the database and bridging them into the Admin CLI for secure recovery.

---

## Phase 9 Features (Phase 1 Governance & Audit Trail)
This module establishes the foundational governance tracking and permanent cryptographic test guards required for enterprise adoption.

### 31. The Governance Registry & Capability Audit
- **Full Schema Metadata:** The control plane (`hq_kormic.db`) enforces a rich metadata registry detailing exactly `what_it_does`, the `assumption`, the `owner`, and whether an agent class is `shared_or_per_person`. This transforms the registry from a simple lookup table into a strict governance record.
- **Auditable Capability Requests:** Every capability verdict (`build_new`, `extend`, `reuse`) requires a detailed `rationale`, `requested_by` attribution, and `registry_consulted` logs, providing an unalterable paper trail for security auditors.
- **Pilot Integration Ready:** The architecture cleanly rejects "fake" placeholder seeds, strictly accepting only real-world helpers (e.g., GitHub Analyzer, Verification Helper) to enforce non-decorative database integrity.

### 32. Permanent Cryptographic Seals (Rule 2)
- **Tamper-Evident Guardrails:** The `constitution_hash` and related guardrails are mathematically sealed inside the birth record payload. Any bit-flip or malicious alteration of the constitution hash triggers an instant `HALT_HARD` signature mismatch across all verifying receivers globally. 
- **Backwards Compatibility:** The verification engine mathematically ensures that legacy agents lacking a constitution hash (`empty-string default`) verify perfectly, preventing fragile regressions across epoch boundaries.

### 33. Phase 2 Versioning Architectural Preparations
- **Class-Match Enforcement Mapping:** The architecture sets the groundwork for Phase 2 Behavior Versioning. `current_behavior_version` upgrades will be mathematically restricted: an agent can only migrate to a behavior where its `class_ref` exactly equals the `derived_from` field sealed inside the original DAIN.
- **Structured Ledger Events:** Event logging (`record_event`) boundaries are mapped to support structured JSON properties, preparing the chain to ingest complex `behavior_version_moved(from, to, by, at)` transition telemetry.

---

## Upcoming Roadmap (Phase 10)
As the Kormic architecture moves toward an enterprise public release, the following phases are scheduled for immediate implementation:

- **Phase 2 Behavior Versioning:** Implementing the `current_behavior_version` pointer and the strict class-match enforcement layer.
- **AWS Cloud Deployment:** Containerizing the `hq_server.py` backend and deploying it behind an Application Load Balancer inside a private VPC.
- **PyPI SDK Packaging:** Bundling the `meshkor` integration library into a formal Python package for seamless `pip install meshkor` integration for customer AI agents.
- **Standalone Admin Executable (`.exe`):** Packaging the `meshkor_admin.py` interactive terminal UI into a zero-dependency, code-signed PyInstaller executable. This allows enterprise CISO administrators to deploy the hardware authentication gateway across Windows endpoints instantly.

## MeshKor Architecture & AWS Deployment (Current State)

This project is now split into a **Centralized SaaS Model**: the **MeshKor HQ Server** (running on AWS) and the **MeshKor SDK** (installed in client Django applications).

### 1. The HQ Server (AWS)
- **Location:** Hosted on a dedicated AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance (	2.medium).
- **Current Public IP:** http://44.193.27.158:8080`n- **How it runs:** Managed professionally via a Linux systemd background service (meshkor-hq.service).
- **Function:** It holds the Master Cryptographic Keys (protected by YubiKey Hardware Escrow). It issues Agent Identity Numbers (AINs) to approved client applications and logs all AI behavior.
- **Code:** All server code lives in the hq_backend/ directory.

### 2. The Client SDK (Pip Package)
- **Location:** Hosted on PyPI (currently TestPyPI as meshkor==1.0.2).
- **Function:** A lightweight, dumb sidecar. It contains no private keys. It points to the AWS HQ URL. When a Kormic AI Agent does something, this SDK wraps the API call and sends a secure log to AWS.
- **Fail-Open Safety:** In Advisory Mode, if the AWS server crashes, the SDK has a 0.2-second timeout and fails open, meaning the host application (Kormic) will never crash just because MeshKor is down.

### 3. The Django Integration (Kormic Host)
- **Database:** The host application (e.g., Kormic Django) must add an in column to its database (e.g., the VerificationCheck model). This acts as a permanent license plate for the agent.
- **Workflow:** Django asks AWS for an AIN -> Django saves the AIN in its DB -> Django uses that AIN for all future MeshKor tracking calls.

### 4. The Admin Console
- **Tool:** meshkor_admin.py`n- **Location:** Runs locally on the Administrator's secure Windows laptop.
- **Security:** Requires physical YubiKey touch to authenticate.
- **Function:** Connects to the AWS Server over the internet to view 'Red Flag' logs and cryptographically revoke/paralyze bad AI agents instantly.


## Developer Integration Quickstart (How to Use MeshKor in Your App)

If you are a developer looking to secure your AI agents using MeshKor, follow this simple 3-step guide. MeshKor is designed to be completely non-intrusive and fail-open (meaning if MeshKor goes down, your app keeps running!).

### Step 1: Install and Database Setup

First, install the SDK:
``bash
pip install meshkor
``

Next, add a simple string column to your application's database to store the Agent Identity Number (AIN). This acts as a permanent 'license plate' for your agent.

**Django Example (models.py):**
``python
from django.db import models

class AIAgentProcess(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    
    # Add this line for MeshKor!
    ain = models.CharField(max_length=120, null=True, blank=True, help_text="MeshKor Identity")
``

### Step 2: Enroll the Agent (Birth)

Whenever your code creates or starts a new AI agent, you must enroll it with the MeshKor HQ to get a cryptographic passport.

**Python Example:**
``python
from meshkor.integrations.kormic import KormicMeshKorIntegration

# 1. Initialize the MeshKor SDK (It will automatically find your AWS HQ)
meshkor = KormicMeshKorIntegration()

def start_ai_agent(db_record):
    # 2. Define what this agent is allowed to do (The Manifest)
    manifest = {
        "permissions": ["read_db", "call_github_api"],
        "owner": "student_123"
    }

    # 3. Enroll the agent to get an AIN (License Plate)
    # Note: If the HQ server is down, this safely returns None (Fail-Open)
    ain = meshkor.enroll_agent(
        agent_class="GitHubAnalyzer",
        instance_ref=f"process_{db_record.id}",
        manifest=manifest,
        constitution_hash="abc123hash..."
    )

    # 4. Save the AIN to your database so you don't forget it!
    db_record.ain = ain
    db_record.save()
    
    print(f"Agent started securely with AIN: {ain}")
``

### Step 3: Record AI Actions (Life)

Whenever your AI agent takes a sensitive action (like reading a file or calling an external API), report it to MeshKor. MeshKor will asynchronously check if the action violates the agent's permissions.

**Python Example:**
``python
def ai_read_file(db_record, filepath):
    # 1. Let MeshKor know what the AI is trying to do
    # (If db_record.ain is None, MeshKor quietly ignores this)
    meshkor.record_event(
        ain=db_record.ain,
        event_type="file_access",
        details={"path": filepath}
    )
    
    # 2. Continue with your normal application logic
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()
``

### That's it!
You have successfully integrated MeshKor. 
- In **Advisory Mode**, bad behavior is simply logged to the AWS Admin dashboard.
- In **Enforced Mode**, if the admin clicks "Revoke", the ecord_event call will instantly raise a RevokedAgentException, freezing the AI in its tracks before it can do harm.
